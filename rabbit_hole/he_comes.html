        <p>Two Seattle Women Charged with Manslaughter and Murder this Afternoon, Judge Decides

                Following yesterday’s car crash on High Rd and Green St, two women have been charged with manslaughter and murder.

                Janice Joanes, 49, has been charged with manslaughter and reckless driving.

                Joanes backed over a 7-year-old boy, in her Ford Fiesta, after he was chasing her with a machete. 

                Marlene Rockswin, 23, was charged with murder after she threw fireworks at Joanes, after seeing the aftermath of the collision with the boy. 

                Neighbours say Rockwin has been in and out of care homes since her <a href="tuckedin.html">youth</a> and doubt the attack on Joanes was provoked. 

                “This was bound to happen sooner or later,” says neighbour Tim Buchard. “But at least the fireworks were pretty.”

                The boy, John, was a first grader at Deep Down Elementary. His teachers say that hours before his death he was seen with bright red eyes and blood dripping from his mouth. 

                The coroner’s office will conduct an autopsy to identify the source of the mysterious blood which was located on his face and clothes. It is blue in colour and warm to the touch.

                “We’ve never seen something quite like this before,” says Police Chief Debra Kosokowsky.</p>
